# üöÄ JavaScript Mastery Journey

Welcome to my **JavaScript Journey** ‚Äì a structured and hands-on learning path inspired by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary)'s teaching style via *Chai aur Code*. This repository is built module by module to help me (and others!) practice, revise, and master core to advanced JavaScript concepts.
